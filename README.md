## Description

This is a React application that showcases my ability to build applications using react as well as a link to more of my work. Information about me, and means of contacting me. 

## Usage

The site is meant to be viewed by potential employers as a showcase of my work. While the site itself is a portfolio piece in its own right it also features other examples of my work. The visitor is able to download an updated version of my resume from the "Resume" page. The "My Work" page features links to four of my projects. Along the bottom of the page are links to my Github profile, Linkedin page and stackoverflow.

## Installation

This is a React application meaning it can be installed by typing the command npx create-react-app into the console.

## Credits

This application was created by Aaron Santowasso with assistance from code derived from class materials that are part of the course.
